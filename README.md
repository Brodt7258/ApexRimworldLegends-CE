### Apex: Rimworld Legends CE Patch

[Apex: Rimworld Legends](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1688705593) compatibility patch for Combat Extended Fastrack.

This version may or may not work properly with the standard CE version, if you're having issues, use fastrack.

The mechanoid weapons borrow the 6/8/12mm railgun ammo from the fastrack Glittertech patch. They're "endgame" weapons, and I thought they should feel proportionately powerful, especially for engaging armored targets at medium to longer ranges.

Otherwise I tweaked the values of some of the other weapons, mostly range and ammo, trying to make their performance more consistent with where I felt they fit in relation to vanilla weapons.

The Mozambique now fires 20g shotgun shells. I've tried to play with the magazine size, burst speed, and recoil to keep it feeling balanced, but CE shotguns are _exceedingly_ powerful within their niche, so it may require further balancing.
